# Introduction

The final project for EECS 205. The task was to create a game with earlier assignments serving as building blocks.
This is a clone of the 1972 classic Pong called Space Pong. What's different? It has a space theme. That is 
about it.

# Game Features

- Two players
- Keyboard inputs for the left player and mouse inputs for the right
- Pause button
- Dissolving title screen
- Scrolling background
- Sound effects for collisions and point scoring

# Repository Contents

Dependencies used in the batch file and throughout the constituent game files are not kept here. When this
game was created, the course used Masm32. This can likely be downloaded from somewhere online to get the
required libraries. Furthermore, some files were assignments for all students in the course.
